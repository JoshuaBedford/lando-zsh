# A simple collection of alias functions to enable the use of CLIs within Lando without having to type 'lando'.
#
# WARNING: This could conflict with any aliases previously installed. If you have any of the CLIs installed globally (outside of lando)
# 		 : The functions *should* enable the ability to not have to type 'lando' before a command by prepending lando for all commands done in the same directory as a .lando.yml file.
