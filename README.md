# Lando ZSH (lando-zsh)
*A simple collection of alias functions to enable the use of the CLIs within Lando without having to type `lando` to access them.*

> Note: I use this personally and decided to share. Use at your own risk and feel free to PR any suggestions.

#### PURPOSE:
To enable the use of common commands in web development without having to prepend `lando` to them. E.G. `lando composer` becomes simply `composer` and `lando npm` becomes `npm`.

The functions *should* enable the ability to not have to type `lando` before a command by prepending 'lando' for all commands executed in the same directory as a .lando.yml config file, but preserve the use of non-lando commands with the same name.

#### WARNING: 
This could conflict with any aliases previously installed. If you have any of the CLIs installed globally (outside of Lando). The `if` statements *should* account for this by calling the non-lando command for you, but not all have been tested fully.
